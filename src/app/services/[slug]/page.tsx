/*
  The detail template. Every one of the five pages is this file — there is no
  per-service JSX anywhere below, and there must not be. Everything that
  differs between services is a field on the Service object, or an entry in the
  two artwork maps directly under this comment.

  RENDERING COST (§4.1).
  generateStaticParams prerenders all five at build time, so they are served
  from the assets binding and cost nothing.

  `dynamicParams = false` is the other half of that, and it matters more than
  it looks. Left at its default of true, a request to /services/anything-at-all
  would be rendered on demand — meaning any crawler or scanner hitting made-up
  URLs could invoke the Worker and burn request quota against the daily cap.
  With it false, anything not in generateStaticParams is a static 404.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  2026-08-21 REBUILD, to the owner's Automation mockup.

  This replaced the R3 restyle wholesale rather than adjusting it. The shape is
  now the mockup's: a split-colour hero with artwork, a "What I build" card
  row, a process row, a closing bar. Four things about it are worth knowing
  before editing.

  1. THREE SECTIONS WERE DROPPED (owner call, mockup 1:1): the FAQ accordion,
     the "Work like this" related-projects grid, and the `problems` panel that
     R3 had made the page's focal block. The first two were an explicit
     decision; `problems` went with them because the mockup has nowhere to put
     it. That leaves `Service.problems` rendered nowhere on the site — it is
     still the field §6 calls the most important one, and putting it back as a
     band between the hero and "What I build" is a small change if the owner
     wants it. The data stays where it is either way.

     The hero's secondary button is what stops the page being a dead end now
     that the related grid is gone: it points at /portfolio.

  2. ONE LAYOUT, FIVE SERVICES. Automation and, as of 2026-08-22, Roblox have
     a mockup and owner-written copy. `servicePage()` in src/data/services.ts
     derives the same structure for the other three out of the content they
     already have, so nothing here branches on a slug except the artwork maps
     below. See that function for what the fallback is built from and why
     nothing in it is invented.

  3. ARTWORK IS OPTIONAL AND PER-SERVICE. A service with no entry in the maps
     renders the same page without it — the hero goes full width, the process
     row loses a column. That is the graceful half of (2).

  4. ACCENT ON HEADINGS. The hero's first line is orange and so is every
     section micro-label. §9.2 reserves orange for actions; §9 makes the
     mockup authoritative where the two disagree, and the home page hero
     already ships the same override on the word "Liam". Noted rather than
     done quietly.

  The card surface shared by the "What I build" cards and the process panel.

  Measured off the mockup rather than reused from the home page's triage cards,
  which are a different treatment: those carry a lit top edge and a round pool
  of light under it, and these have neither. Sampling a card here gives a fill
  of rgb(11,11,12) against a section background of rgb(7,7,9) — barely lifted,
  with a faint warmth pooling at the bottom-left corner rather than the top.

  Hence a low-peak warmGlowImage() anchored at "0% 100%", over --color-surface
  at half strength. Same shared gradient as every other panel on the site; only
  the origin and the peak differ, which is what §9.4 asks for instead of a
  second hand-written radial.

    puts a whole sentence in the title and has no caption, so the same grid
    would give it a 110px column to hold twelve words. Keying off the presence

                TWO ARRANGEMENTS, CHOSEN BY THE CONTENT. Automation's mockup
                puts the icon beside the heading and left-aligns the whole
                panel, above a three-point checklist. Roblox's stacks the icon
                over a centred heading and centres the button, and has no
                checklist under it.

                Keyed off `points.length` rather than off the slug for the
                reason `denseCards` above is: this is a property of what the
                panel contains, not of which service it belongs to. A panel
                with a list has a left edge that the list establishes and the
                heading should share; a panel without one is three centred
                things in a column, and left-aligning them leaves the short
                second line hanging. A future service inherits whichever
                arrangement its own content asks for, with no flag to set.

                On the left-aligned branch: the icon shares the heading's line
                rather than sitting above it, which was tried and abandoned —
                at the 14rem this column gets, stacking left the heading room
                for four lines of two words each.
