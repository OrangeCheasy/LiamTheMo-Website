/*
  The line-art icon set the service pages are drawn from (the "What I build"
  cards, the process steps, the artwork's status rows, the panel bullets).

  WHY A REGISTRY RATHER THAN AN ICON LIBRARY. §3 rules out new dependencies
  without a stated tradeoff, and the trade here is bad: every icon package
  ships hundreds of glyphs to get the dozen this site draws, and none of them
  are drawn to the rules the rest of the site already follows. Sixteen paths in
  one file costs a fraction of a kilobyte and stays consistent by construction.

  SAME DRAWING RULES AS ServiceGlyph AND THE ABOUT SECTION'S THREE VIRTUES:
  stroke-only, 24-unit box, round caps and joins, one shared stroke weight
  unless a glyph genuinely needs its own. `code` is the one that does, for the
  reason written up beside the About section's copy of it — three open strokes
  cover far less area than a closed form, so at the shared weight it reads
  thin next to its neighbours.

  DOTS ARE ZERO-LENGTH PATHS ("M9 10.5h.01"). With round caps that renders as
  a filled circle of exactly the stroke width, which is how the speech
  bubble's dots stay on the same optical weight as the outline around them. A
  real <circle> would need its own radius and would drift the moment the
  stroke changed.

  WHY IT IS SEPARATE FROM ServiceGlyph. That one is keyed by ServiceSlug and
  answers "which service is this" — five glyphs, one per service line, used on
  the project cover tiles. This one is keyed by shape and answers "what does
  this card mean". Merging them would mean one registry where half the keys
  are only valid in half the call sites.

    Cog: hub inside a lobed outline.

    THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS A HUB PLUS EIGHT RADIAL SPOKES, on the theory that a
    many-toothed outline would turn to mud at the 28px these render at. It did
    not read as a cog at all — with no rim joining the spokes it renders as a
    sun, which is what shipped for one pass and had to be pulled. The rim is
    the part that carries the meaning, so it stays even though it is the
    longest path in this file.

    The Roblox mark: a tilted rounded square with a tilted square cut out of
    it. Added for the Roblox service page's "View My Work" button, which the
    owner's mockup sets with this rather than the generic `window` every other
    secondary CTA uses.

    DRAWN IN THIS SET'S OWN IDIOM — two stroked paths at the shared weight,
    not a traced copy of the brand asset. It is a recognisable reference at
    16px beside a button label, which is all the mockup asks of it, and it
    inherits currentColor and the stroke weight like every other glyph here
    instead of importing a foreign shape with its own fill rules.

    The rotation is baked into the coordinates rather than applied as a
    transform, so the glyph composes with `className` the same way the rest
    do — a transform here would be silently overridden by any caller that
    sets one.
