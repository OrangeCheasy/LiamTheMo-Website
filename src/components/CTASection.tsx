/*
  The reusable bottom-of-page conversion block (CLAUDE.md §5, §15 Phase 2).

  It exists because of success criterion 2 in §2 — every page ends with a path to
  the quote form — and building it once here means the service, portfolio and
  about pages inherit it at steps 3, 4 and 6 rather than each growing its own.

  Server component. It is a heading, a paragraph and a link.

  The reply promise is not marketing copy invented here: §8 fixes the wording of
  the form's success state as "I'll reply within one business day", and saying
  something different before the click than after it would be a broken promise.

  MOCKUP PANEL: the warm radial gradient is Phase 2's home-page treatment —
  no border on the panel itself (owner correction after the first pass added
  one the mockup doesn't have); depth comes from the gradient alone, per
  §9.4's "glow over box-shadow." `title`/`description`/`ctaLabel` stay
  overridable because every other page using this component (services,
  portfolio, about) has its own, page-specific copy — the mockup only shows
  the home page, so only the home page's call passes mockup-exact copy. The
  panel styling itself (gradient, pill button) applies everywhere, since
  that's a visual system choice, not page content.

          Warm gradient panel, anchored top-left, fading into the surface
          tone — §9.4's "soft radial glow beats a black box-shadow" applied to
          the panel itself rather than just a hover state. No border: depth
          comes from the gradient alone, matching the mockup exactly.

          The gradient itself now comes from `warmGlow()` in src/lib/glow.ts,
          where the full derivation from the mockup's pixel data is written up.
          It moved there when the owner asked for the home page's service cards
          to carry the same glow — two hand-copied stop lists would have drifted
          the first time either was touched. The default arguments reproduce
          what was inline here byte for byte, so this panel is unchanged.

        {/*
          THREE BACKGROUND LAYERS, and the order is the whole point. CSS
          paints the first layer on top, so this reads: deep-brown overlay,
          then the warm glow, then the page-dark base underneath.

          The brown has to be ABOVE the gradient. The owner's note was that
          this panel looked brighter and more orange than the mockup, and
          sampling the mockup bears it out — its field is #100c09 and its
          brightest corner only #201008, where the old build ran the glow at
          peak 32 over --color-surface and landed several times hotter. A
          darker base alone cannot fix that, because the glow is painted on
          top of the base; only a layer over the glow mutes the orange.

          Peak dropped 32 -> 14 for the same reason. That number was fitted
          from the PREVIOUS mockup (the derivation is still in glow.ts and
          still correct for the panels that use the default); this panel is
          simply darker in the new one. Every other warmGlow() caller is
          untouched — the change is an argument here, not a new default.
