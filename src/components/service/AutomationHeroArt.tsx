  The Automation service page's hero artwork (owner mockup, 2026-08-21).

  BUILT AS DOM, NOT SHIPPED AS A PICTURE — the same call the home page's
  HeroArt runs on, for the same reasons and with the same payoff. The mockup
  renders a photographed laptop with a code editor on it and four UI cards
  floating around it; everything here that carries meaning is real text, so it
  stays sharp at any zoom or DPR, recolours with the tokens, and costs zero
  bytes of image payload against §12's budget. A 1500px render of this
  composition would have been the single heaviest asset on the site.

  WHAT IS NOT REPRODUCED: the photographic laptop body. CSS cannot do a
  photoreal machine convincingly, and a bad one costs more than no one. What
  it gets instead is a tilted screen on a trapezoid deck — enough to read as a
  laptop, honest about being a drawing.

  MOBILE PAYS NOTHING. The page renders this `hidden lg:block`, the same as
  HeroArt: on a phone the artwork is decorative weight between the headline
  and the content that converts.

  DECORATIVE, SO aria-hidden THROUGHOUT. The heading and blurb beside it
  already say what the service is; a screen reader announcing "Read files,
  completed in 0.3 seconds" would be reading set dressing as if it were
  content. That is also what settles the numbers question — see below.

  THE NUMBERS ARE ILLUSTRATION (owner call). "12.4 hours per week", "0.3s",
  "1.2s", "0.8s" are drawn exactly as the mockup has them. They are not claims
  about real jobs: they sit inside a fake application UI, the whole block is
  aria-hidden, and §11's ban on inventing results is about copy that a visitor
  would read as a promise. Flagged rather than done quietly, because "Time
  Saved 12.4 hours" is the one item here that could be mistaken for one. Same
  precedent as HeroArt's fake timecode and file tree.

  NO ANIMATION (§9.5). A hero that animates its own fake terminal on load is
  the dated-template look the anti-goals rule out, and there is nothing here
  for prefers-reduced-motion to suppress.

  SIZED BY @container, NOT BY BREAKPOINTS, and the first pass got this wrong in
  a way worth recording. Every type size in here was originally keyed to `xl:`
  — a VIEWPORT width — while the thing that actually decides whether "Generate
  output" fits on one line is how wide this box is. Those two came apart
  immediately: at a 1536px viewport the page is well past xl, so every label
  jumped to its large size, but the box itself is only whatever is left after
  the hero's copy column takes its 33rem, and the labels truncated to
  "Generate...". Keying off the container measures the right thing, and it
  keeps working if the hero's column split is ever retuned.

   impression on exactly the visitor most likely to notice. */

        830x380 is the art region measured off the mockup (x 650..1480,
        y 80..460 at its native 1536px width). Holding that ratio is what keeps
        the four cards clear of each other as the column narrows, since every
        position below is a percentage of this box.

        EVERY SIZE INSIDE IS RELATIVE TO THIS BOX'S OWN WIDTH. The root sets
        1.2cqw — 1.2% of the container's width, which is the mockup's ~10px
        code size against its 830px art region — and every child sizes itself
        in `em` off that. So the whole drawing is one scalable object: give it
        a wider column and the code, the cards, the ticks and the padding all
        grow together in the mockup's exact proportions.

        THE SIZE LIVES ON AN INNER WRAPPER, NOT ON THIS ELEMENT. Container
        query units resolve against the nearest ANCESTOR container — an element
        cannot query itself, or the font size it sets would feed back into the
        size being queried. Written on this div, 1.2cqw silently fell back to
        1.2% of the VIEWPORT and rendered the whole drawing at roughly triple
        size. One wrapper inside the container fixes it.

        THIS REPLACED BREAKPOINT SIZING, and the failure is worth recording.
        The sizes were first written as fixed rem values with `xl:` steps, then
        as `@xl:` container steps. Both are jumps between two hand-picked
        sizes, and neither can hold a ratio: at the width this column actually
        gets, the code block came out proportionally 25% larger than the
        mockup's and overflowed the laptop screen, clipping halfway through the
        snippet. A ratio problem needs a ratio unit.
