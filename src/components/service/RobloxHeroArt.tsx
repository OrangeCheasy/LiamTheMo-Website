/*
  The Roblox service page's hero artwork (owner mockup, 2026-08-22): a
  character standing in front of a glowing archway, in a tree-lined scene lit
  warm from the portal.

  BUILT AS DOM, NOT SHIPPED AS A PICTURE — the same call AutomationHeroArt
  runs on, for the same reasons: the mockup's version is a photoreal 3D
  render, and reproducing one in CSS convincingly is not possible. What this
  draws instead is honest about being a drawing — a blocky figure built from
  the same rounded rectangles every panel on the site already uses, standing
  in a scene built from the same primitives (silhouette shapes, a warm glow,
  one border colour). It costs zero image bytes against §12's budget, where
  the mockup's own render would have been the heaviest asset on the site.

  WHY BLOCKY IS THE RIGHT SIMPLIFICATION, not just the easiest one: a low-poly,
  rectangular avatar is Roblox's own default aesthetic, not a compromise away
  from it. A character built from a head, a torso and one arm reads as "a
  Roblox character" precisely because that is what the classic Roblox avatar
  is built from.

  MOBILE PAYS NOTHING. Rendered `hidden lg:block` by the page template, same
  as AutomationHeroArt — decorative weight the smallest devices never pay for.

  DECORATIVE, SO aria-hidden THROUGHOUT. The heading and blurb beside it
  already say what the service is.

  NO ANIMATION (§9.5). A static scene, nothing here for
  prefers-reduced-motion to suppress.

          THE HEIGHT IS LOAD-BEARING, not a tuning value. Every part below is
          sized in percentages of this box, and a percentage height resolves
          against an ancestor with a definite one. Without `height` here the
          wrapper was auto — sized by its content — so the head's `h-[24%]`
          and the torso's `h-[48%]` had nothing to resolve against, collapsed
          to zero, and the character rendered as nothing at all. The scene
          shipped as an empty arch and two trees. Do not remove it, and do not
          replace it with a Tailwind `h-` class either: `height` and the parts'
          own percentages have to stay readable as one set of proportions.

          justify-end pins the stack to the bottom edge so the figure stands on
          the ground line rather than floating above it — the parts add up to
          72% of this box, and flex-start would have left that 28% underneath. */}
