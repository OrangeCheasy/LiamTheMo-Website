/*
  The five service lines (CLAUDE.md §1). This file is the whole services system:
  /services and /services/[slug] are generated from it, so adding a sixth service
  means adding one object here and nothing else.

  RULES THAT SHAPED THE CONTENT — read before editing.

  `problems` is the most important field on the page. Each line is a SYMPTOM in
  the visitor's own words, first person, describing a Monday morning rather than
  a capability. "I retype the same numbers every week" earns recognition;
  "data entry automation" does not. If an edit here starts sounding like a
  service description, it has gone wrong.

  `startingPrice` and `turnaround` are absent from every entry. That is
  deliberate and required by §10 — the owner has not set prices or delivery
  times, and both fields are optional in the type for exactly this reason.
  Do NOT add "contact for pricing" as a value; omitting the field is the
  supported way to say nothing.

  `faqs` contains only answers the owner has confirmed. A question whose honest
  answer would be a business policy that has not been set is left out rather
  than guessed. Policies that apply to every service live in `commonFaqs` below
  rather than being copied into all five objects.

  NO `relatedProjects` FIELD. It used to hold hand-maintained forward
  references to project slugs, written before projects.ts existed. Removed
  2026-08-21 (resolves the TODO that used to sit here): it had already drifted
  — `excel-data` still pointed at "excel-performance-dashboard", a project
  that has never existed — and nothing read it. `projectsForService()` in
  projects.ts derives the real list from each project's own `services` array
  instead, which cannot drift the same way. See that function's comment.

      THE ART-DIRECTED PAGE (owner mockup, 2026-08-21). Roblox got its own
      mockup and `page` object on 2026-08-22 (see that object, further down
      this file); the other three still fall through to `servicePage()`
      below, which is what renders when a service has no `page` of its own.

      REGISTER. This page is louder than the rest of the site on purpose: the
      mockup's heading is a claim ("Automation that works for you"), where §11
      normally asks for the outcome in the visitor's own words. The `problems`
      array above still holds that voice, and it is what the quote form and the
      home page's triage cards run on. This copy is the shopfront; that copy is
      the diagnosis.

      NOTHING HERE IS A RESULT CLAIM. No hours saved, no client count, no
      turnaround promise — §11's hard rule, and the reason the panel's three
      points are commitments about how I work rather than numbers.

      THE SECOND ART-DIRECTED PAGE (owner mockup, 2026-08-22). Automation's

      REGISTER STAYS TECHNICAL, same call as `problems` above and for the same

      "Get Started" is the template's own hardcoded primary-button label
      (ServiceDetailPage), shared by every service page and left alone here.
      The mockup's second button reads "View My Work" rather than Automation's

 * What the page template renders for a service, whether or not it has been

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The 2026-08-21 rebuild moved /services/[slug] to the
 * owner's mockup: a split-colour hero with artwork, a card row, a step row,
 * and a closing bar. Automation and, as of 2026-08-22, Roblox have a mockup
 * and owner-written copy for those. The other three still have to render —
 * §15 is explicit that no phase may leave the site half-styled in
 * production — and there are only three ways to do that:
 *
 *   1. keep the old template alive behind a flag, so two layouts ship at once;
 *   2. write new hero copy for three services nobody has approved (§11);
 *   3. build the same layout out of the content those services already have.
 *
 * This is (3). Every string below is either the service's own approved data or
 * a heading already shipping on the previous template — nothing here is
 * invented. The result is visibly plainer than the two art-directed pages,
 * which is accurate: it is plainer, until its own mockup lands.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING FROM THE FALLBACK. No `panel` — its three
 * points are promises about how the work goes, and there is no approved list
 * of those for the other services. An empty panel or a guessed one are both
 * worse than the template simply not drawing it.
