# CLAUDE.md

Project instructions for Claude Code. Read this before touching anything in the repo.

**This version supersedes the pre-redesign CLAUDE.md.** Stack, hosting, and workflow sections are unchanged. §1, §2, §9, §10, §11, and §12 were rewritten for the dark/orange redesign.

---

## 1. What this project is

**liamthemo.com** — a personal portfolio that doubles as a lead-generation site for freelance client work.

Two jobs, weighted differently per visitor:

| Visitor | Arrives via | Wants to know | Converts by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Roblox / dev client** | Discord, referral, project listing | Is this person good? | Seeing the work |
| **Small-business owner** | Search, word of mouth, local referral | Can this person fix my problem? | Finding their symptom, then the form |

The design serves the first. The information architecture serves the second. **Neither may be sacrificed for the other.** A change that makes the site more beautiful but harder for a restaurant owner to navigate is a bad change. A change that adds a conversion element looking like a template is also a bad change.

### Service lines

| Service line | What's sold |
|---|---|
| Automation & Python | Scripts, repetitive-task automation, data parsing, CSV/PDF processing, small-business tools, API/integration work |
| Excel & Data | Custom spreadsheets, automated reports, dashboards, sales/performance trackers, data cleanup |
| Websites | Small-business sites, landing pages, restaurant/menu sites, portfolio sites, maintenance |
| Local Tech Help | Computer setup, Windows/software troubleshooting, printers, Wi-Fi/networking, file transfers, backups |
| Roblox Development | Luau scripting, gameplay systems, UI systems, DataStore systems, bug fixes, optimization |

### Lead handling

Submissions route through email routing, Discord webhooks, and the on-site form, all landing directly with the owner. This is built and working. **Do not redesign, replace, or "improve" the delivery pipeline.** Restyling the form is in scope; changing where submissions go is not.

---

## 2. Success criteria

Judge every change against these, in order:

1. **Does a non-technical visitor find their own problem within one screen of scrolling?** This is the home page's Services section (`ServicesSection.tsx`, §7) — the symptom-worded triage cards, restored after their Phase 2 removal. Passing again as of 2026-08-17.
2. **Does the work look impressive?** Real screenshots and project art, shown large. This is the portfolio half earning its keep.
3. **Does every page end with a path to the form?**
4. **Does it load fast on a phone on mobile data?** A dark, image-heavy design makes this harder. See §12.
5. **Does it look like one person with taste, not a template?**

If a proposed feature serves none of these, say so and recommend cutting it. Flag scope creep out loud.

---

## 3. Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript, strict mode |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Source control | GitHub |
| Dev environment | GitHub Codespaces |
| Hosting | **Cloudflare Workers** via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` |
| Deploy tooling | Wrangler + GitHub Actions |
| Domain | liamthemo.com (Cloudflare DNS) |

### Why Cloudflare and not Vercel

Vercel's free Hobby tier prohibits commercial use, and defines "commercial" to include any site built or hosted for financial gain — a freelancer's own lead-generation site qualifies. Cloudflare Workers has no such restriction. The tradeoff is a worse developer experience: an adapter, a `wrangler.jsonc`, a deploy workflow, and more care around environment variables. That cost is already paid. **Do not reintroduce Vercel-specific APIs or assume Vercel behaviour anywhere in this codebase.**

**Rules:**
- No new dependencies without justification. State the tradeoff first. A 40 KB animation library for one fade is a bad trade — and in this redesign that temptation will come up repeatedly.
- Tailwind only. No CSS-in-JS, no UI kit, no component library.
- Server Components by default. `"use client"` only where interactivity genuinely requires it: mobile nav, quote form, scroll-triggered animation.
- **Node.js runtime only.** Never set `export const runtime = "edge"`.
- Content lives in typed files under `src/data/`. No CMS, no database.
- Prefer static rendering. Every page that can be prerendered must be. See §4.1.

---

## 4. Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # next dev — everyday work
npm run build      # next build — must pass before any PR
npm run lint       # eslint
npx tsc --noEmit   # typecheck

npm run preview    # runs the real Worker locally
npm run deploy     # production deploy
npm run cf-typegen # regenerate Cloudflare binding types
```

`npm run build` and `npx tsc --noEmit` must both pass before opening a PR.

Anything touching a route handler, server action, middleware, environment variable, **or `next/image`** must be verified with `npm run preview` before the PR opens. `next dev` runs in Node; production runs in workerd.

### 4.1 The free-tier budget

| Limit | Free plan |
|---|---|
| Worker requests | 100,000/day, resets 00:00 UTC |
| CPU time | 10ms per invocation |
| Static asset requests | Free and unlimited — never invoke the Worker |
| Worker bundle size | 3 MB |

A statically prerendered page is served from the assets binding and costs nothing. A dynamic page burns request quota and CPU. Everything except `/contact` should be static.

- Do not add `force-dynamic`, uncached `fetch`, `cookies()`, or `headers()` to a page with no reason to be dynamic. Each silently converts a free page into a metered one.
- Exceeding the daily cap returns Cloudflare error 1027 — the site goes down rather than billing you.
- Upgrading is $5/month and requires no code changes. Don't contort the architecture to stay free; just don't waste the tier carelessly.

### 4.2 Required config

`wrangler.jsonc` at the repo root must retain `nodejs_compat`, the `assets` binding, and the `images` binding. Do not hand-edit `.open-next/`.

### 4.3 Environment variables

Cloudflare separates build-time from runtime, and getting this wrong is the most common OpenNext failure.

- **Build-time** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, anything read during `next build`) → GitHub Actions secrets/vars.
- **Runtime** (form delivery keys, Discord webhook URL) → `wrangler secret put`, read server-side only.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` is compiled into the client bundle and is public. **The Discord webhook URL must never be a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable** — a public webhook URL is an open spam endpoint.

If a build fails on an undefined variable that "definitely exists in Cloudflare," it was set at runtime and needed to be build-time.

```

Service and portfolio pages generate from data files. Adding a sixth service = one object in `services.ts`, nothing else.

---

## 6. Data model

Keep these in `src/lib/types.ts`. Do not change shapes without updating every consumer.

```ts
export type ServiceSlug =
  | "automation" | "excel-data" | "websites" | "local-tech-help" | "roblox";

export interface Service {
  slug: ServiceSlug;
  title: string;
  tagline: string;           // one line, benefit-first, no jargon
  icon: string;
  problems: string[];        // symptoms in the client's words
  deliverables: string[];
  process: string[];         // 3–4 steps, plain language
  startingPrice?: string;    // omit rather than guess
  turnaround?: string;
  faqs: { q: string; a: string }[];
  relatedProjects: string[];
}

export interface Project {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  client?: string;
  services: ServiceSlug[];
  summary: string;
  problem: string;
  solution: string;
  result: string;            // quantified where possible
  stack: string[];
  cover: { src: string; alt: string };   // required — this design is card-led
  images?: { src: string; alt: string }[];
  featured: boolean;
}
```

`cover` is required in this redesign. The featured work grid is the visual centrepiece; a project without art breaks it.

### Portfolio entries

- **Restaurant Sales Parser** — flagship. Proof for Automation *and* Excel & Data. Lead with time saved per week.
- **Fuse Factory** — proof for Roblox.
- **Orange Cheasy** — proof for Roblox.
- **Excel Performance Dashboard** — proof for Excel & Data.

Case studies are **problem → solution → result**. Stack goes in a sidebar for technical readers, never the lead. A restaurant owner cares that Monday went from two hours to five minutes, not that it uses pandas.

---

## 7. Service routing on the home page

**Restored, as `ServicesSection.tsx`.** This section originally specified the triage widget (`ServiceTriage.tsx`, "What can I help you with?" — six symptom-worded cards). It was removed from the home page during Phase 2 by explicit owner instruction, then restored on 2026-08-17 — also by owner instruction — as the home page's "Services" section. Same mechanic, same six options, same discipline; it sits after Featured Work rather than directly under the hero, and it is a plain container section rather than a full-bleed band, matching the rest of the rebuilt home page.

**Why it came back:** removing it left the home page with no way to reach a specific service without already knowing its slug. That gap is now closed.

**The discipline it is built on, which any edit must keep:** labels describe the visitor's symptom ("I retype the same numbers every week"), never the service name ("Python Scripting"); the "I'm not sure what I need" option is the one that reaches the form directly, at `/contact?topic=unsure`, since a meaningful share of good leads land there.

**2026-08-18, owner call:** that option used to be a full-width row with an accent border, and this paragraph called it "first-class rather than a fallback at the end of the list." It is now the sixth card in an even grid of six, marked only by its accent-tinted chip and by sitting last. The emphasis is gone; the wording above is corrected rather than left describing a page that no longer exists. The labels-are-symptoms rule is untouched and still absolute — the same pass tightened the copy's register ("I have a repetitive task" → "I repeat the same task every week") without letting any label become a service name.

**How it is reached:** by scrolling the home page, or by any link to `/#services` — the section owns that anchor. The header nav item that used to point at it now reads "Home" and points at `/` (owner call, 2026-08-17), so the header is no longer one of those links; see §14.

---

## 8. Quote form (`QuoteForm.tsx`)

**Fields:** name, email, service (prefilled), description, budget range (select, not free text), timeline, preferred contact method. Seven maximum.

- Validate client-side *and* server-side.
- Submit says "Send request"; success says "Request sent." Same verb.
- Success state states what happens next and when. Not just a checkmark.
- Errors say what went wrong and how to fix it.
- Honeypot field. Rate limiting via Cloudflare WAF rules on the handler path — blocked requests never invoke the Worker, protecting both the inbox and the request budget. No in-Worker counter, no KV.
- Delivery secrets in Wrangler secrets, server-side only. **The existing email routing and Discord webhook pipeline works — restyle the form, do not rewire the delivery.**
- Keep the handler lean: one outbound call, no heavy parsing. Well under 10ms CPU.

---

## 9. Design system

**Direction: molten dark.** Warm near-black, a single high-energy orange, generous space, real work shown large. Confident and personal — a maker's site, not an agency's.

The redesign source of truth is the approved homepage mockup. Where this document and the mockup disagree, raise it rather than guessing.

### 9.1 Tokens

**The site is dark only.** There is no light theme and no theme toggle. Define tokens as CSS custom properties on `:root` and expose them to Tailwind via the theme config. **Never hardcode a hex value in a component.**

```
  --bg              #0B0A0A   warm near-black, not pure #000
  --surface         #141212   cards, raised panels
  --surface-2       #1C1919   hover, nested surfaces
  --border          #2A2626   hairline, low contrast
  --text            #F5F3F1   warm white
  --text-muted      #A8A19C
  --accent          #FF6A1A
  --accent-hover    #FF8340
  --accent-dim      rgba(255,106,26,0.12)   glow, tints, focus rings
```

**Neutrals are warm-tinted on purpose.** Pure grey next to orange reads dead and cheap. Do not "clean up" these values to neutral greys.

The five service identity hues carry a `-tint` variant each (`--color-service-*-tint`), derived from the base hue with `color-mix` rather than hardcoded. The full-strength pastels were drawn for a light UI and read as stickers on this background; chips sitting on a dark surface use the tint. The one deliberate hardcoded colour in the codebase is the glow's `#ff3a00` in `src/lib/glow.ts` — an owner colour choice for a single effect, kept local rather than promoted to a token nothing else would use.

Set `color-scheme: dark` on `:root` so browser-rendered UI — form controls, scrollbars, autofill backgrounds — matches. Without it, autofilled inputs render with a white background that looks broken against the dark surface.

Because there is no light theme, tokens may be used directly and confidently. Do not add conditional theme logic, `dark:` variants, or a `data-theme` attribute "for later." If a light theme is ever wanted, it is a deliberate future project, not something to scaffold for now.

### 9.2 Accent discipline

Orange marks **actions and current state**. Nothing else.

- Links, buttons, active nav, focus rings, hover glow, the logo: accent.
- Section labels, dividers, body copy, card borders at rest, decorative flourishes: **not** accent.

If orange appears on something that cannot be clicked, it's wrong. This discipline is what makes the mockup look designed rather than decorated — orange everywhere looks like a Bootstrap theme.

**One standing exception: the small label above a section heading.** The mockup sets those in accent ("About Me", and by extension "Services"), and §9 makes the mockup authoritative where it and this document disagree. The home page shipped that way in Phase 2 and the service pages followed in R3, so the pairing — accent micro-label, then a neutral `text-h2` — is now the site-wide convention for section headers. Nothing else non-interactive gets accent: not dividers, not body copy, not card borders at rest, not decorative marks.

### 9.3 Type

- One heading face with character, one highly legible body face. Self-host via `next/font` — no external font CDN, which adds a render-blocking third-party request.
- Headings: tight tracking, weight 600–700, large. The mockup's hero is roughly 56–64px desktop.
- Body: 16–17px, line height 1.6+. Muted colour for secondary copy.
- Sentence case everywhere, including buttons.
- Set a real type scale in the Tailwind config and use it. No arbitrary `text-[27px]`.

### 9.4 Surfaces and depth

- Cards: `--surface`, 1px `--border`, radius 12–16px.
- Depth comes from **contrast and warm glow**, not drop shadows. A soft radial `--accent-dim` behind a focal element beats a black box-shadow, which disappears on dark backgrounds anyway.
- Hover: border shifts toward accent, subtle lift, glow appears. Under 200ms.

**The warm corner glow is one shared implementation**, `warmGlow()` in `src/lib/glow.ts` — the closing CTA panel and the home page's service cards both call it, with the ellipse and peak opacity varied per element. Its stop list traces a fitted exponential falloff derived from the mockup; the derivation is written up in that file. Do not hand-write a second radial gradient for a new element, and do not "simplify" the stop list to two stops — the curve is what makes a low peak opacity read as depth instead of a flat wash. Since a gradient's colour stops cannot be transitioned, hover strength is a second glow layer faded in over the resting one rather than an animated gradient.

### 9.5 Motion

- Subtle and purposeful. Hover transitions, at most one scroll-reveal per section.
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` on every animation.** Not optional.
- No parallax, no scroll-jacking, no animated gradient meshes, no cursor followers. These read as dated template and cost CPU on mobile.

### 9.6 Anti-goals

Do not produce:
- Orange on non-interactive elements
- Pure `#000` background or pure grey neutrals
- Glassmorphism, frosted blur panels, animated gradient blobs
- Stock photography or generic 3D illustration where real project art could go
- Neon glow on text. Glow belongs on surfaces and focal images, not typography.

**2026-08-17, superseded in part:** the "Clean Code / Thoughtful Design / Problem Solver" trio and a generic-3D-render hero image were both on this list. The owner supplied a new mockup and declared it authoritative over both calls — the trio is back in the home page's About section, and the hero is now a photoreal desk-scene render at `/homepage/hero.webp` (see `HeroArt.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`). §11's "no generic virtue blocks" rule is superseded the same way.

---

## 10. Dark-only commitments

There is no light theme. That removes a large amount of work, but it makes three things non-negotiable, because a dark site has no fallback when they're wrong.

**Contrast.** Dark backgrounds hide low-contrast text far more effectively than light ones do, and `--text-muted` on `--surface` is the pairing most likely to fail. Every text/background combination must pass WCAG AA. `--accent` on `--bg` passes for large text and UI elements; it does **not** pass for small body copy, so never set paragraph text in orange.

**Focus states.** A default browser focus ring is a thin dark outline and is effectively invisible here. Every interactive element needs an explicit, high-contrast focus ring built from `--accent`, tested by tabbing through the page rather than assumed from the code.

**Browser-rendered UI.** Form controls, autofill, scrollbars, and selection highlights default to light styling. `color-scheme: dark` handles most of it; autofill on inputs usually needs an explicit override. Check the contact form after any browser has saved credentials against it.

**The upside worth protecting:** dark-only means the hero artwork, the glow treatments, and the project cover art only ever need to work against one background. Do not spend that saved effort adding theme abstraction back in.

---

## 11. Copy rules

- Sentence case everywhere.
- **Lead with the outcome, follow with the method.** "Stop retyping your weekly numbers" beats "Python-based data automation."
- The hero must do outcome work, not just identity work. A personal introduction is fine as the opening line, but a visitor must learn *what problem you solve* without scrolling. "I design and build digital experiences" fails this test — it tells a restaurant owner nothing.
- **No generic virtue blocks.** "Clean code, thoughtful design, problem solver" appears on thousands of developer portfolios and signals nothing. If a three-column block earns its place, fill it with specifics: what you actually build, who for, what changed as a result.
- No superlatives, no "cutting-edge," no "passionate about."
- **Never invent** client names, testimonials, review counts, years of experience, or project results. If a number isn't known, leave it out and flag a TODO. Fabricated social proof is the fastest way to lose a real client.
- Publish only prices the owner has confirmed.
- Roblox pages may use technical language — there it builds credibility. Everywhere else, plain language wins.

---

## 12. Quality floor

Every page ships with:
- Keyboard navigation with **explicit, high-contrast focus states** — default browser rings are invisible on dark. Verify by tabbing, not by reading the code.
- Semantic HTML: headings in order, real buttons, real links, labels tied to inputs
- Alt text on every image, including project art
- Responsive from 320px
- WCAG AA contrast on every text/background pair, `--text-muted` on `--surface` especially
- Per-page `metadata`: title, description, Open Graph
- `next/image` for all images, verified under `npm run preview` — the Cloudflare images binding means optimization doesn't work by default the way it would on Vercel

### Performance budget

This design is image-heavy and dark, which makes performance harder. Non-negotiable:

- **Lighthouse performance ≥ 90 on mobile.** If a visual choice can't hold that, the visual choice loses.
- Hero image: WebP or AVIF, responsive `sizes`, `priority` set. It is the LCP element — treat it as one.
- Project cover art: lazy-loaded below the fold, correctly sized. Never ship a 2000px PNG scaled down in CSS.
- Total homepage image payload target: **under 600 KB**. Report the actual number after building the home page.
- No more than two web font weights per family. Subset where possible.

### SEO

- **Confirm `robots` is not set to `noindex`.** The pre-redesign site shipped `noindex, nofollow`, making it invisible to search. Verify in the built output, not just the source.
- Each service page targets a plain-language phrase a real person would search.
- Include location terms on Local Tech Help — that service is geographically bound.
- Ship `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts`. Add LocalBusiness structured data.

---

## 13. Git workflow and deployment

```
feature branch → npm run dev → npm run preview
              → commit + push → PR (CI: lint, typecheck, build)
              → merge to main → GitHub Actions → wrangler deploy → live
```

- Branches: `feat/theme-tokens`, `fix/mobile-nav`, `content/parser-case-study`
- Never commit directly to `main`. `main` is production.
- Commit messages: imperative and specific.
- One concern per PR. A PR that adds a feature and restyles the footer is two PRs.
- `.env.local`, `.open-next/`, `.wrangler/` stay gitignored. If a secret is committed, rotate it — don't just delete the line.
- Deploy runs from GitHub Actions on merge to `main`. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` scoped to Workers deploy only.
- Broken production: `wrangler rollback` first, diagnose after.

---

## 14. Working agreement for Claude

**Do:**
- Explain *why*, not just what. The owner is building professional practice, not collecting snippets.
- State tradeoffs plainly, including when the simpler option beats the requested one.
- Push back on ideas that are overbuilt, hard to maintain solo, or unlikely to convert.
- Build reusable pieces. This site is a template for future client work.
- Propose visual direction in a sentence or two and wait for sign-off before building a new section.
- Flag when a change would convert a static page into a dynamic one.
- Flag when a visual choice threatens the performance budget **before** building it.

**Don't:**
- Weaken the home page's Services section (§7) — it is how a visitor who doesn't know what the work is called finds it. (This used to read "Don't drop Services from the nav"; the owner replaced that nav item with "Home" on 2026-08-17, so the section itself now carries the whole job.)
- Rewire the form delivery pipeline.
- Assume Vercel. No `@vercel/*`, no Vercel env var names, no `runtime = "edge"`.
- Reach for KV, D1, R2, or Durable Objects. A portfolio with a contact form needs none of them.
- Add a CMS, auth, analytics dashboard, or blog engine unless asked.
- Hardcode colours instead of using tokens.
- Add theme-switching logic, `dark:` variants, or a `data-theme` attribute. The site is dark only by decision, not by default.
- Refactor unrelated files while implementing a feature.
- Invent content, credentials, or results.
- Leave `console.log` or commented-out code in a PR.

---

## 15. Redesign build order

The site is live and working. **This is a restyle of a functioning site, not a rebuild.** Do not delete working pages to start fresh.

0. Dark-only tokens and fonts; remove the existing theme toggle and any light-theme code — ship with existing layout intact
1. Navbar + Footer restyle (Services returns to nav, toggle gone)
2. Home: hero, then featured work grid, then the Services section, then a short about section, then closing CTA (the triage cards were cut here by owner override, then restored on 2026-08-17 — see §7)
3. Services detail template — restyled 2026-08-17 to the home page's rhythm (container sections, accent micro-labels, triage-card surfaces); `problems` promoted to the page's focal block on an accent-dim glow panel, deliverables and process paired in one row below it. **There is no services index and none is planned** — §7's home-page Services section replaced it, so that half of this step is closed rather than outstanding. Data, routing, `generateStaticParams` and `dynamicParams` were untouched; all five pages verified still prerendered (● SSG) after the restyle.

   **Rebuilt again 2026-08-22 to the owner's Automation mockup**, superseding the R3 restyle above. The page is now: split-colour hero with per-service artwork → "What I build" card row → process row (artwork, numbered steps, promise panel) → closing bar. Four things this changed that the paragraph above no longer describes:

   - **Three sections were dropped**, on the owner's explicit "mockup 1:1" call: the FAQ accordion, the "Work like this" related-projects grid, and the `problems` focal panel R3 had just built. `Service.problems` and `Service.faqs` are still in the data and are now rendered nowhere; `projectsForService()` in `projects.ts` lost its only caller. See §16.
   - **The hero's second button is the proof link.** With the related grid gone, "View Examples" → `/portfolio` is the only route from a service page to the work.
   - **One layout, five services.** Only Automation has a mockup and owner-written copy (`Service.page`, typed as `ServicePage`). `servicePage()` in `services.ts` derives the same structure for the other four from `deliverables` and `process`, using only approved strings — no invented copy, and no second layout live in production. Their own mockups replace that as they land.
   - **Artwork is DOM, not images** (`src/components/service/`), the same call `HeroArt.tsx` runs on, so the page adds zero image payload. It is sized in `cqw`/`em` off its own container rather than in breakpoints, because what decides whether a label fits is the artwork's width, not the window's.

   Two mockup details were deliberately not reproduced, both flagged rather than done quietly: the filled orange buttons take **dark** ink, not the mockup's white (white on `--color-accent` is 2.9:1 against the 4.5:1 §10 requires); and the process artwork keeps a dimmed accent frame, which is orange on something non-interactive, allowed only because it is part of an illustration.
4. Portfolio index + case study template
5. Contact page restyle — **form logic and delivery untouched**
6. About
7. Performance and accessibility pass; confirm indexing is on

Ship each phase as its own PR. The site stays live and coherent throughout — no phase leaves it half-styled in production.

---

## 16. Open decisions

Flag rather than deciding:

- [x] Heading and body typefaces — kept Bricolage Grotesque + Inter (Phase 0), already self-hosted and already matching §9.3 before the redesign started
- [x] Nav label — neither "Work" nor "Portfolio". Owner chose **"Projects"** (Phase 1), used consistently in nav, footer, and internal links/metadata
- [x] Three-virtue block — reversed 2026-08-17. Owner supplied a new mockup and put it back in the home page About section (Clean Code / Thoughtful Design / Problem Solver, three columns with icons), superseding the Phase 2 cut. See §9.6.
- [ ] Real before/after metrics for the Restaurant Sales Parser
- [ ] Whether starting prices are published or quote-only
- [ ] Service area wording for Local Tech Help — remote, local, or both
- [ ] Nav label "Work" vs "Projects" — the 2026-08-17 mockup shows "Work" in the header nav, contradicting the Phase 1 "Projects" decision above. Not changed yet; only the hero image and About section were in scope for this pass. Flag to the owner before touching it.
- [ ] What happens to `problems` and `faqs` — the 2026-08-22 service-page rebuild (§15 step 3) left both rendered nowhere on the site. `problems` is the field §2's first success criterion and §6 both lean on: six symptom lines per service, in the visitor's own words, and the only place a small-business owner reads their own Monday morning back to them. `faqs` is thirty-odd sentences of answered, indexable copy that §12's SEO rules want. Dropping them was the owner's explicit "mockup 1:1" call and the pages are better-looking for it, but the content is still written and still good. Three ways back if wanted: a `problems` band between the hero and "What I build", the FAQ appended above the closing bar, or both folded into the mockups for the remaining four services.
- [ ] `projectsForService()` in `src/data/projects.ts` — no callers since the same rebuild removed the related-work grid. Left in place rather than deleted, because the reverse link (case study → service) still uses the same `Project.services` field and the function is how proof comes back if the section above returns. Delete it if the answer to the previous item is "no".
